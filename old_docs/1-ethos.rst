The toytree ethos
=================

Welcome to **toytree**, a minimalist tree manipulation and plotting library. 
Toytree combines a popular Tree data structure based on the `ete3 <http://etetoolkit.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial_trees.html>`__ library with
modern plotting tools based on the `toyplot <http://toyplot.rtfd.io>`__ plotting 
library. The goal of toytree is to provide a light-weight Python equivalent to  commonly used tree manipulation and plotting libraries in R, and in doing so, to promote further development of phylogenetic and other tree-based methods in Python.

Toytree Goals:  

+ **style**: beautiful "out-of-the-box‚Äù figures that require minimal styling.
+ **customization**: extensive style options using CSS semantics. 
+ **simplicity**: several pre-defined plotting styles (e.g., coalescent, dark-mode).
+ **tree manipulation**: easily traversable class object. Rooting, ordering, etc.
+ **tree statistics**: edge lengths, node heights.
+ **tree comparisons**: cloud tree plotting, Robinson-Fould's calculations.
+ **transparency**: interactive plots make raw data available as pop-ups.
+ **reproducibility**: code and plots in jupyter notebooks.
+ **extendability**: combine with toyplot scatterplots, barplots, colormapping, etc.
+ **minimalism**: lightweight, easy installation.
