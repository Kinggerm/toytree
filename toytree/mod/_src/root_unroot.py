r"""Class for rooting and unrooting of trees.

Rooting and unrooting trees turns out to be quite a bit more
complicated than you might expect. The difficult part is keeping
track of Node features that in practice are coded as attributes to
Nodes, but in reality are sometimes features of *edges*, such as
'support' or 'dist', and thus need to be re-assigned when an parent
child relationships change.

Re-rooting a rooted tree:
               o                            x
              / \                          / \
             1   2         root('n')      n   u
                / \          -->             / \
               .   u                        2   .
                  / \                      / \
                 .   n                    1   .

Rooting an unrooted tree:
                                            x
                                           / \
              _ 2 _        root('n')      n   u
             |  |  |         -->             / \
             1  .  u                        2   .
                  / \                      / \
                 .   n                    1   .
