    """Return ToyTree rooted on midpoint of longest edge.

    Rooting on the "midpoint" assumes a clock-like evolutionary rate
    (i.e., branch lengths are equal to time) and may yield odd results
    when this assumption is violated. This algorithm calculates the
    pairwise path length between all tips in an unrooted tree and roots
    on the midpoint of the longest path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tree: ToyTree
        Tree that will be (re-)rooted.
    inplace: bool
        If True then the input tree object is modified and returned,
        else a copy of the tree is modified and returned.

def root_on_minimal_ancestor_deviations(

):
    """Return ToyTree rooted on edge that minimizes ancestor deviations.

    The minimal ancestor deviation (MAD) rooting method attempts to
    accommodate the effect of rate heterogeneity on branch lengths when
    rooting a tree by branch length information. This is done by using
    pairwise topological and metric information in unrooted trees. It
    assumes that branch lengths are additive and that tips (OTUs) are
    contemporaneous in time (i.e., tip height variation results from
    rate heterogeneity). This method evaluates the deviations of the
    global midpoint root position from each pairwise midpoint rooting
    position and minimizes it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tree: ToyTree
        A tree with branch lengths on which to infer a MAD rooting.
    ...
    assign_rij_values_to_nodes: bool
        If True the returned tree will include a feature 'rij' on every
        Node with a float score of the root-mean-square of its pairwise
        relative deviations (rij). Downstream analysis can treat these
        values as root probabilities and integrate over alternative
        hypotheses (i.e., use a 'root neighborhood' approach sensu
        Tria et al 2017).
